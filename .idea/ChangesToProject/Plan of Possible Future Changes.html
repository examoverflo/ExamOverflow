<h1>Possible Future Changes</h1>
1) Give students the ability to have a username rather then have there Tnumber displayed.
<br>
This could increase the amount of answers a student posts because<br>
some students may not want to answer questions because there TNumber is visible to everyone.
<br>
<br>
2) Possible way to introduce a student rating based on there answers.
<br>
This would make ExamOverflow more realistic and give students an excuse to answer more questions.
<br>
<br>
3) The introduction of a way to differentiate questions.
<br>
This would make it easier for a student to search ExamOverflow for a specific type of question ie: Java related.
<br>
<br>
4) Intoduce a specific type of questions relevant to past exam papers<br>
<br>
This would give ExamOverflow a new feature and make it an easier place for students to find answers to past exam questions.
