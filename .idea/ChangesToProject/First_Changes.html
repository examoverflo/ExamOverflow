1) The introduction of 2 enums (topic + module)<br>
<br>
2) The separation of General Questions and Exam Questions<br>
</h2>
<br>
<br>
1) We decided that to further the progress of our questions we could introduce two enums, topic for a general question<br>
and module for an exam question. By doing this it makes questions easier to find and to ensure the question asked is in<br>
the correct section. As well as this we believe it will make the sorting of general questions easier and ensure similar<br>
questions can be found easily. This brought us to the idea of splitting general questions and exam questions, we decided <br>
to do this to save the user time and to allow students to easily locate answers to past exam papers. In the exam question<br>
there will be a module enum that will order the questions easily.
<br>
<br>
<br>
2) From looking at the question class we decided that it was very broad and will provide problems for users to find specific<br>
questions. As well as this we realised we could add an extra feature, as it is students using ExamOverflow we came to the plan<br>
to introduce a specific exam question feature. This will make it easier for students to look through past exam questions and easily<br>
locate the exam question from a specific year, by using the exam year and the newly introduced module.
